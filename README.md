# Github - Learners Guide

This Git learns guide will help you learn ‘What is version control?,’ different types of version controls, the importance of Git, Course content and many other important concepts related to Git. If you are an Git aspirant and preparing for any [Git certification](https://intellipaat.com/git-github-training/), this article will be helpful for you. Considering that, let us jump into our conversation on the overview of Git.

## Overview of Git

Be it a designer, a creator, or a developer, all deal with projects and files every day. Our primary work cycle revolves around creating a file, saving it, editing or making required changes, and saving it again. In this Git tutorial, we will be focusing on What is Git? and thereby understanding the life of a developer.Git is a small yet very efficient version control tool. It helps both programmers and non-programmers keep track of the history of their project files by storing different versions of them. 

## What is Git?

Git helps developers keep track of the history of their code files by storing them in different versions on its own server repository, i.e., GitHub. Git has all the functionality, performance, security, and flexibility that most of the development teams and individual developers need.

## Why Git Version Control?
Below are some of the facts that make Git so popular:

Works offline: Git provides users very convenient options such as allowing them to work both online and offline. With other version control systems like SVN or CVS, users need to have access to the Internet to connect to the central repository.
Undoes mistakes: Git allows us to undo our commands in almost every situation. We get to correct the last commit for a minor change, and also we can revert a whole commit for unnecessary changes.
Restores the deleted commits: This feature is very helpful while dealing with large projects when we try out some experimental changes.
Provides security: Git provides protection against secret alteration of any file and helps maintain an authentic content history of the source file.
Guarantees performance: Being a distributed version control system, it has an optimized performance due to its features like committing new changes, branching, merging, comparing past versions of the source file, etc.
Offers flexibility: Git supports different nonlinear development workflows, for both small and large projects.
